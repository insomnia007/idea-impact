Abstract â€“ Prof. Jan Nowak: Algorithms and Editorial Management

This talk investigates the intersection of algorithms and editorial decision-making in contemporary media environments. With the proliferation of recommendation systems, automated moderation, and AI-assisted writing, the management of editorial teams has become increasingly entangled with computational logics. The abstract traces how algorithmic curation shapes newsroom priorities, affects journalistic autonomy, and challenges ethical standards. Drawing from comparative case studies, the lecture outlines the dilemmas of balancing efficiency with accountability, as well as transparency with competitive secrecy. The proposed framework suggests managerial practices for integrating algorithmic systems responsibly within newsroom workflows.

The proposed framework suggests managerial practices for integrating algorithmic systems responsibly within newsroom workflows.  This talk investigates the intersection of algorithms and editorial decision-making in contemporary media environments. With the proliferation of recommendation systems, automated moderation, and AI-assisted writing, the management of editorial teams has become increasingly entangled with computational logics.
